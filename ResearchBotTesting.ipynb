       "As of September 2025, several AI agent frameworks have emerged, each offering unique capabilities for developing intelligent, autonomous systems:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Agent Lightning**: A flexible framework enabling reinforcement learning-based training of large language models (LLMs) for any AI agent. It decouples agent execution from training, allowing seamless integration with existing agents and supporting complex interaction logic. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03680?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF)**: Utilizes LLMs and mathematical frameworks to design adaptive AI agents for dynamic environments. PCF enables real-time parameter reconfiguration through combinatorial spaces, supporting scalable and ethical AI applications. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01581?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **GoalfyMax**: A protocol-driven multi-agent system that introduces a standardized Agent-to-Agent communication layer based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It incorporates an Experience Pack architecture for structured knowledge retention and continual learning. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09497?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Cognitive Kernel-Pro**: An open-source, multi-module agent framework designed to democratize the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents. It focuses on curating high-quality training data and enhancing agent robustness through novel strategies. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00414?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore**: Introduced by AWS, AgentCore simplifies the development and deployment of advanced AI agents. It offers modular services supporting the full production lifecycle, including scalable serverless deployment and context management. ([techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/pro/aws-looks-to-super-charge-ai-agents-with-amazon-bedrock-agentcore?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "- **OpenAI Swarm**: Focuses on multi-agent collaboration, enabling AI agents to connect with external sources, coordinate, and tackle complex processes. It utilizes OpenAI's language models for advanced decision-making abilities. ([signitysolutions.com](https://www.signitysolutions.com/blog/top-ai-agent-frameworks?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
